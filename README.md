# Book Club  :books:
:dart: The book club web application will follow the MVC framework. I am going to be using C#, SQL, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and React. 

:bar_chart: The application is going to display the books in a table based on their average rating.  

:computer: Members can log-in and add/or edit books. Each member can submit their rating which will then be displayed in a table.

:woman: The book club consists of 5 members and each member can rate a book between 1-5 (0.25 increments).

:star: Once the application has 5 ratings total it will calculate the average score and display the rating in the table.
